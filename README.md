# UP4
__Description :__

UP4 is a Video Game inspired by connect four, designed by Bastien Lextrait and myself Romain Maurizot The goal is for each player to make a row, column or diagonal of 4 checkers. The particularity is that there are special cells that can alter the board orientation and behaviour of the falling checker.

The whole game is done with Unity3D.

The game has a menu where you can choose the language, the variant game mode, whether to play against someone or an IA.

There is a level editor in unity Editor where you can choose the layout of the grid, the triggers, if there are any existing pawns, etc.


I went back to university in sept 2017 and as a result, had to put development on hold.
